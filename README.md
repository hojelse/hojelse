### I'm Kristoffer 👋

> I love solving problems in visually engaging ways and find satisfaction in automating the boring stuff.

🎨 I am a designer turned developer

📚 I am studying Software Development at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk)

🧽 I am currently being the best knowledge sponge i can, soaking up everything from DevOps to React.js

🔍 I've recently gained experience with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) on a NATS monitoring tool in collaboration with SimCorp [/SimCorp/nats-topology-visualiser](https://github.com/SimCorp/nats-topology-visualiser)
