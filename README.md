### Whale hello there, I'm Kristoffer 🐳👋

> I love solving problems in visually engaging ways and find satisfaction in automating the boring stuff.


🎨 I am a graphic designer turned coder

📚 I study Software Development at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk)

🌍 I live in Denmark 🇩🇰

🧽 I am currently a pure pleasure-directed knowledge sponge soaking up everything from DevOps to React.js

🔍 I've recently learned some [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) on a project with SimCorp on NATS monitoring tool [/SimCorp/nats-topology-visualiser](https://github.com/SimCorp/nats-topology-visualiser)

🌱 I am currently learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) by building a site [/creative-nest/creative-nest](https://github.com/creative-nest/creative-nest)
 which is also deployed with Docker and Kubernetes
